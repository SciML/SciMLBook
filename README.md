# Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML): Methods and Applications

This book is a compilation of lecture notes from the MIT Course 18.337J/6.338J: Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning. 
Links to the old notes https://mitmath.github.io/18337 will redirect here.

This repository is meant to be a live document, updating to continuously add the latest details on methods from the field of 
scientific machine learning and the latest techniques for high-performance computing.

## Editing the SciML Book

This is a `Franklin.jl` site.
Much of the material originated from Julia Markdown Documents (`*.jmd`).
Each of these documents are `Weave.jl`-ed with a custom template,
and the resulting HTML is inserted into a corresponding markdown file. Updating
the files in `_weave` will automatically update the webpages.

The theme is adapted from [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
