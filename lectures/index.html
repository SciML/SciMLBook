What is scientific machine learning? We will define the field by looking at a few approaches people are taking and what kinds of problems are being solved using scientific machine learning. The field of scientific machine learning and its span across computational science to applications in climate modeling and aerospace will be introduced. The methodologies that will be studied, in their various names, will be introduced, and the general formula that is arising in the discipline will be laid out: a mixture of scientific simulation tools like differential equations with machine learning primitives like neural networks, tied together through differentiable programming to achieve results that were previously not possible. After doing a survey, we while dive straight into developing a physics-informed neural network solver which solves an ordinary differential equation.</p> <h2 id=lecture_4_introduction_to_discrete_dynamical_systems ><a href="#lecture_4_introduction_to_discrete_dynamical_systems" class=header-anchor >Lecture 4: Introduction to Discrete Dynamical Systems</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;GhBARuHEydM">How Loops Work 1: An Introduction to the Theory of Discrete Dynamical Systems &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/AXHLyHfyEuA">How Loops Work 2: Computationally-Efficient Discrete Dynamics &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/04-How_Loops_Work-An_Introduction_to_Discrete_Dynamics/">How Loops Work, An Introduction to Discrete Dynamics &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <h3 id=optional_extra_resources__4 ><a href="#optional_extra_resources__4" class=header-anchor >Optional Extra Resources</a></h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Dynamics-Chaos-Applications-Nonlinearity/dp/0738204536">Strogatz: Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://mathinsight.org/equilibria_discrete_dynamical_systems_stability">Stability of discrete dynamics equilibrium</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://chrisrackauckas.com/assets/Papers/ChrisRackauckas-ContinuousDynamics.pdf">Behavior of continuous linear dynamical systems</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/FBVector.md">Golden Ratio Growth Argument</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/16305">Golden Ratio Growth PR and timings</a></p> </ul> <p>Now that the stage is set, we see that to go deeper we will need a good grasp on how both discrete and continuous dynamical systems work. We will start by developing the basics of our scientific simulators: differential and difference equations. A quick overview of geometric results in the study of differential and difference equations will set the stage for understanding nonlinear dynamics, which we will quickly turn to numerical methods to visualize. Even if there is not analytical solution to the dynamical system, overarching behavior such as convergence to zero can be determined through asymptotic means and linearization. We will see later that these same techniques for the basis for the analysis of numerical methods for differential equations, such as the Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods.</p> <p>Since the discretization of differential equations is indeed a discrete dynamical system, we will use this as a case study to see how serial scalar-heavy codes should be optimized. SIMD, in-place operations, broadcasting, heap allocations, and static arrays will be used to get fast codes for dynamical system simulation. These simulations will then be used to reveal some intriguing properties of dynamical systems which will be further explored through the rest of the course.</p> <h2 id=lecture_5_array-based_parallelism_embarrassingly_parallel_problems_and_data-parallelism_the_basics_of_single_node_parallel_computing ><a href="#lecture_5_array-based_parallelism_embarrassingly_parallel_problems_and_data-parallelism_the_basics_of_single_node_parallel_computing" class=header-anchor >Lecture 5: Array-Based Parallelism, Embarrassingly Parallel Problems, and Data-Parallelism: The Basics of Single Node Parallel Computing</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/eca6kcFntiE">The Basics of Single Node Parallel Computing &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/05-The_Basics_of_Single_Node_Parallel_Computing/">The Basics of Single Node Parallel Computing &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <h3 id=optional_extra_resources__5 ><a href="#optional_extra_resources__5" class=header-anchor >Optional Extra Resources</a></h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="http://ithare.com/wp-content/uploads/part101_infographics_v08.png">Chart of CPU Operation Costs</a></p> </ul> <p>Now that we have a concrete problem, let&#39;s start investigating ways to parallelize its solution. We will first see that many systems have an almost automatic way of parallelizing through array operations, which we will call array-based parallelism. The ability to easily parallelize large blocked linear algebra will be discussed, along with libraries like OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, CuBLAS &#40;GPU parallelism&#41; and Elemental.jl. This gives a form of Within-Method Parallelism which we can use to optimize specific algorithms which utilize linearity. Another form of parallelism is to parallelize over the inputs. We will describe how this is a form of data parallelism, and use this as a framework to introduce shared memory and distributed parallelism. The interactions between these parallelization methods and application considerations will be discussed.</p> <h2 id=lecture_6_styles_of_parallelism ><a href="#lecture_6_styles_of_parallelism" class=header-anchor >Lecture 6: Styles of Parallelism</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/EP5VWwPIews">The Different Flavors of Parallelism: Parallel Programming Models &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/06-The_Different_Flavors_of_Parallelism/">The Different Flavors of Parallelism &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p>Here we continue down the line of describing methods of parallelism by giving a high level overview of the types of parallelism. SIMD and multithreading are reviewed as the basic forms of parallelism where message passing is not a concern. Then accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs are introduced. Moving further, distributed parallel computing and its models are showcased. What we will see is that what kind of parallelism we are doing actually is not the main determiner as to how we need to think about parallelism. Instead, the determining factor is the parallel programming model, where just a handful of models, like task-based parallelism or SPMD models, are seen across all of the different hardware abstractions.</p> <h2 id=lecture_7_ordinary_differential_equations_applications_and_discretizations ><a href="#lecture_7_ordinary_differential_equations_applications_and_discretizations" class=header-anchor >Lecture 7: Ordinary Differential Equations: Applications and Discretizations</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/riAbPZy9gFc">Ordinary Differential Equations 1: Applications and Solution Characteristics &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/HMmOk9GIhsw">Ordinary Differential Equations 2: Discretizations and Stability &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/07-Ordinary_Differential_Equations-Applications_and_Discretizations/">Ordinary Differential Equations: Applications and Discretizations &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p>In this lecture we will describe ordinary differential equations, where they arise in scientific contexts, and how they are solved. We will see that understanding the properties of the numerical methods requires understanding the dynamics of the discrete system generated from the approximation to the continuous system, and thus stability of a numerical method is directly tied to the stability properties of the dynamics. This gives the idea of stiffness, which is a larger computational idea about ill-conditioned systems.</p> <h2 id=lecture_8_forward-mode_automatic_differentiation ><a href="#lecture_8_forward-mode_automatic_differentiation" class=header-anchor >Lecture 8: Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/zHPXGBiTM5A">Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation &#40;AD&#41; via High Dimensional Algebras &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/08-Forward-Mode_Automatic_Differentiation_&#40;AD&#41;_via_High_Dimensional_Algebras/">Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation &#40;AD&#41; via High Dimensional Algebras &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p>As we will soon see, the ability to calculate derivatives underpins a lot of problems in both scientific computing and machine learning. We will specifically see it show up in later lectures on solving implicit equations f&#40;x&#41;&#61;0 for stiff ordinary differential equation solvers, and in fitting neural networks. The common high performance way that this is done is called automatic differentiation. This lecture introduces the methods of forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation to setup future studies uses of the technique.</p> <h2 id=lecture_9_solving_stiff_ordinary_differential_equations ><a href="#lecture_9_solving_stiff_ordinary_differential_equations" class=header-anchor >Lecture 9: Solving Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations</a></h2> <h3 id=lecture_notes ><a href="#lecture_notes" class=header-anchor >Lecture Notes</a></h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/bY2VCoxMuo8">Solving Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/09-Solving_Stiff_Ordinary_Differential_Equations/">Solving Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <h3 id=additional_readings_on_convergence_of_newtons_method ><a href="#additional_readings_on_convergence_of_newtons_method" class=header-anchor >Additional Readings on Convergence of Newton&#39;s Method</a></h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007&#37;2F978-1-4612-0701-6_8">Newton&#39;s Method</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1844/34b366f337972aa94a601fabd251d0baf62f.pdf">Relaxed Newton&#39;s Method</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S00243795130067820">Convergence of Pure and Relaxed Newton Methods</a></p> <li><p><a href="http://cswiercz.info/2016/01/20/narc-talk.html">Smale&#39;s Alpha Theory for Newton Convergence</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1091">alphaCertified: certifying solutions to polynomial systems</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1503/1503.03543.pdf">Improved convergence theorem for Newton</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~wgilbert/Research/GilbertFractals.pdf">Generalizations of Newton&#39;s Method</a></p> </ul> <p>Solving stiff ordinary differential equations, especially those which arise from partial differential equations, are the common bottleneck of scientific computing.

This lecture will explore where reverse-mode AD intersects with scientific modeling, and where machine learning begins to enter scientific computing.</p> <h2 id=lecture_12_sciml_in_practice ><a href="#lecture_12_sciml_in_practice" class=header-anchor >Lecture 12: SciML in Practice</a></h2> <h3 id=lecture_121_mpi_for_distributed_computing ><a href="#lecture_121_mpi_for_distributed_computing" class=header-anchor >Lecture 12.1: MPI for Distributed Computing</a></h3> <p>Guest Lecturer: Lauren E.

In this lecture we will look into other algorithms which are utilizing the connection between neural networks and machine learning. We will generalize to augmented neural ordinary differential equations and universal differential equations with DiffEqFlux.jl, which now allows for stiff equations, stochasticity, delays, constraint equations, event handling, etc. to all take place in a neural differential equation format. Then we will dig into the methods for solving high dimensional partial differential equations through transformations to backwards stochastic differential equations &#40;BSDEs&#41;, and the applications to mathematical finance through Black-Scholes along with stochastic optimal control through Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We then look into alternative training techniques using reservoir computing, such as continuous-time echo state networks, which alleviate some of the gradient issues associated with training neural networks on stiff and chaotic dynamical systems. We showcase a few of the methods which are being used to automatically discover equations in their symbolic form such as SINDy. To end it, we look into methods for accelerating differential equation solving through neural surrogate models, and uncover the true idea of what&#39;s going on, along with understanding when these applications can be used effectively.</p> <h2 id=lecture_16_probabilistic_programming ><a href="#lecture_16_probabilistic_programming" class=header-anchor >Lecture 16: Probabilistic Programming</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/32rAwtTAGdU">From Optimization to Probabilistic Programming &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/16-From_Optimization_to_Probabilistic_Programming/">From Optimization to Probabilistic Programming &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p>All of our previous discussions lived in a deterministic world. Not this one. Here we turn to a probabilistic view and allow programs to have random variables. Forward simulation of a random program is seen to be simple through Monte Carlo sampling. However, parameter estimation is now much more involved, since in this case we need to estimate not just values but probability distributions. It turns out that Bayes&#39; rule gives a framework for performing such estimations. We see that classical parameter estimation falls out as a maximization of probability with the &quot;simplest&quot; form of distributions, and thus this gives a nice generalization even to standard parameter estimation and justifies the use of L2 loss functions and regularization &#40;as a perturbation by a prior&#41;. Next, we turn to estimating the distributions, which we see is possible for small problems using Metropolis Hastings, but for larger problems we develop Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It turns out that Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has strong ties to both ODEs and differentiable programming: it is defined as solving ODEs which arise from a Hamiltonian, and derivatives of the likelihood are required, which is essentially the same idea as derivatives of cost functions&#33; We then describe an alternative approach: Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference &#40;ADVI&#41;, which once again is using the tools of differentiable programming to estimate distributions of probabilistic programs.</p> <h2 id=lecture_17_global_sensitivity_analysis ><a href="#lecture_17_global_sensitivity_analysis" class=header-anchor >Lecture 17: Global Sensitivity Analysis</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/wzTpoINJyBQ">Global Sensitivity Analysis &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/17-Global_Sensitivity_Analysis/">Global Sensitivity Analysis &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p>Our previous analysis of sensitivities was all local. What does it mean to example the sensitivities of a model globally? It turns out the probabilistic programming viewpoint gives us a solid way of describing how we expect values to be changing over larger sets of parameters via the random variables that describe the program&#39;s inputs. This means we can decompose the output variance into indices which can be calculated via various quadrature approximations which then give a tractable measurement to &quot;variable x has no effect on the mean solution&quot;.</p> <h2 id=lecture_18_code_profiling_and_optimization ><a href="#lecture_18_code_profiling_and_optimization" class=header-anchor >Lecture 18: Code Profiling and Optimization</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/h-xVBD2Pk9o">Code Profiling and Optimization &#40;Lecture&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/notes/18-Code_Profiling_and_Optimization/">Code Profiling and Optimization &#40;Notes&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p>How do you put everything together in this course?

There are ways which it can be handled similar to automatic differentiation. Measurements.jl gives a forward-propagation approach, somewhat like ForwardDiff&#39;s dual numbers, through a number type which is representative of normal distributions and pushes these values through a program. This has many advantages, since it allows for uncertainty quantification without sampling, but turns the number types into a value that is heap allocated. Other approaches are investigated, like interval arithmetic which is rigorous but limited in scope. But on the entirely other end, a non-general method for ODEs is shown which utilizes the trajectory structure of the differential equation solution and doesn&#39;t give the blow up that the other methods see. This showcases that uses higher level information can be helpful in UQ, and less local approaches may be necessary. We end by showcasing the Koopman operator as the adjoint of the pushforward of the uncertainty measure, and as an adjoint method it can give accelerated computations of uncertainty against cost functions.</p> <h2 id=final_project ><a href="#final_project" class=header-anchor >Final Project</a></h2> <p>The final project is a 10-20 page paper using the style template from the <a href="http://www.siam.org/journals/auth-info.php"><em>SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis</em></a> &#40;or similar&#41;. The final project must include code for a high performance &#40;or parallelized&#41; implementation of the algorithm in a form that is usable by others. A thorough performance analysis is expected.
